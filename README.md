# x402-rs

> Rust-based implementation of the x402 protocol facilitator.

[x402 Protocol](https://docs.cdp.coinbase.com/x402/docs/overview) defines a standard for making blockchain payments directly through HTTP 402 flows.

The _Facilitator_ simplifies adoption of x402 by handling:

* **Payment verification**: Confirming that client-submitted payment payloads match the declared requirements.
* **Payment settlement**: Submitting validated payments to the blockchain and monitoring their confirmation.

By using a Facilitator, servers (sellers) do not need to:

* Connect directly to a blockchain.
* Implement complex cryptographic or blockchain-specific payment logic.

Instead, they can rely on the Facilitator to perform verification and settlement, reducing operational overhead and accelerating x402 adoption.

## Current Features

This repository currently implements a _Facilitator_ role according to the x402 specification.

**Responsibilities:**
- _Verify Payments:_ Confirm that submitted payment payloads are valid.
- _Settle Payments:_ Submit validated payments on-chain.
- _Return Results:_ Provide clear verification and settlement responses to the resource server.

The Facilitator **does not hold funds**. It acts purely as an execution and verification layer based on signed payloads.

For a detailed overview of the x402 payment flow and Facilitator role, see the [x402 protocol documentation](https://docs.cdp.coinbase.com/x402/docs/overview).

## Roadmap

This project provides a Rust-based implementation of the x402 payment protocol, focused on reliability, ease of integration, and support for machine-native payment flows.

The initial focus is on establishing a stable, production-quality Rust SDK and middleware ecosystem for x402 integration.

## Usage

### 1. Provide environment variables

Create a `.env` file or set environment variables directly. Example `.env`:

```dotenv
HOST=0.0.0.0
PORT=8080
RPC_URL_BASE_SEPOLIA=https://sepolia.base.org
RPC_URL_BASE=https://mainnet.base.org
SIGNER_TYPE=private-key
PRIVATE_KEY=0xdeadbeefdeadbeefdeadbeefdeadbeefdeadbeefdeadbeefdeadbeefdeadbeef
RUST_LOG=info
```

**Important:**
The supported networks are determined by which RPC URLs you provide:
- If you set only `RPC_URL_BASE_SEPOLIA`, then only Base Sepolia network is supported.
- If you set both `RPC_URL_BASE_SEPOLIA` and `RPC_URL_BASE`, then both Base Sepolia and Base Mainnet are supported.
- If an RPC URL for a network is missing, that network will not be available for settlement or verification.

### 2. Build and Run with Docker

Build the Docker image:

```commandline
docker build -t x402-rs .
```

Run the container:
```commandline
docker run --env-file .env -p 8080:8080 x402-rs
```

The container:
* Exposes port `8080` (or a port you configure with `PORT` environment variable).
* Starts on http://localhost:8080 by default.
* Requires minimal runtime dependencies (based on `debian:bullseye-slim`).

### 3. Point your application to your Facilitator

If you are building an x402-powered application, update the Facilitator URL to point to your self-hosted instance.

Example using Hono and x402-hono (from [x402.org Quickstart for Sellers](https://x402.gitbook.io/x402/getting-started/quickstart-for-sellers)):

```typescript
import { Hono } from "hono";
import { serve } from "@hono/node-server";
import { paymentMiddleware } from "x402-hono";

const app = new Hono();

// Configure the payment middleware
app.use(paymentMiddleware(
  "0xYourAddress", // Your receiving wallet address
  {
    "/protected-route": {
      price: "$0.10",
      network: "base-sepolia",
      config: {
        description: "Access to premium content",
      }
    }
  },
  {
    url: "http://localhost:8080", // üëà Your self-hosted Facilitator
  }
));

// Implement your protected route
app.get("/protected-route", (c) => {
  return c.json({ message: "This content is behind a paywall" });
});

serve({
  fetch: app.fetch,
  port: 3000
});
```

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è **Tip:** For production deployments, ensure your Facilitator is reachable via HTTPS and protect it against public abuse.

## Environment Variables

The service reads configuration via `.env` file or directly through environment variables.

Important variables:

* `HOST`: HTTP host to bind to (default `0.0.0.0`)
* `PORT`: HTTP server port (default `8080`)
* `RUST_LOG`: Logging level (e.g., `info`, `debug`, `trace`)
* `RPC_URL_BASE_SEPOLIA`: Ethereum RPC endpoint for Base Sepolia testnet
* `RPC_URL_BASE`: Ethereum RPC endpoint for Base mainnet
* `SIGNER_TYPE`: Type of signer to use. Only `private-key` is supported now.
* `PRIVATE_KEY`: Private key in hex, like `0xdeadbeaf...`.

### Supported Networks

The Facilitator supports different networks based on the environment variables you configure:

| Network      | Environment Variable   | Supported if Set | Notes                   |
|:-------------|:-----------------------|:-----------------|:------------------------|
| Base Sepolia | `RPC_URL_BASE_SEPOLIA` | ‚úÖ                | Recommended for testing |
| Base Mainnet | `RPC_URL_BASE`         | ‚úÖ                | Mainnet deployment      |

- If you provide only `RPC_URL_BASE_SEPOLIA`, only **Base Sepolia** will be available.
- If you provide both `RPC_URL_BASE_SEPOLIA` and `RPC_URL_BASE`, then both networks will be supported.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è **Tip:** For initial development and testing, you can start with Base Sepolia only.
